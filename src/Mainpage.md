# escrapper

An EFL-based  web scrapper, indexer and offline viewer.

# Starting

Its non-standard for C source code, the main entry is called elm_main().

To learn more on the API, you can start from the Config or the Scrapper 
structs.

Another important part is the _Logger struct and the logger.h header file 
that prevent the output to be printed in unit tests and backup the output 
in a *log file*.

You can also read the file list to know more about the project organisation.
